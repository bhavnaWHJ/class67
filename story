Once upon a time there lived a monkey who resided on a jamun tree, which was on the banks of river. 
In the same forest there lived a crocodile and his wife.....One day the crocodile came to the banks 
of the river and rested under the tree. The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits. The crocodile
came back the next day to have more fruits. As the days passed by the crocodile and the monkey became 
good friends. One day the crocodile's wife was feeling hungary. She called her husband and asked him to 
betray his friend and bring him for my lunch today.
